# Comprehensive Audit System Design

## Problem Analysis
Based on our development history, we've encountered these issue patterns:
- **"No dilemmas found"** - API/DB connection issues
- **"No responses found"** - localStorage/data flow mismatches  
- **404s/502s/504s** - API endpoint failures
- **Race conditions** - Async operations timing issues
- **Data shape mismatches** - API contract violations
- **Variable name inconsistencies** - Refactoring artifacts

## Minimum Viable Audit Architecture

### 1. Headless Browser Automation (Playwright)
```
Complete User Journey Tests:
├── Landing Page Load
├── Dilemma Flow (12 steps)
├── Values Generation  
├── Research Export
└── Error State Handling
```

### 2. API Contract Validation
```
Schema Validation Tests:
├── GET /api/dilemmas → Dilemma[]
├── POST /api/generate-values → ValuesResult
├── GET /api/research/export → CSV
└── POST /api/responses → Success
```

### 3. Error Detection & Classification
```
Error Categories:
├── Network Errors (404, 502, 504)
├── Data Mismatches (shape, types)
├── State Inconsistencies (localStorage)
├── Race Conditions (timing)
└── Business Logic Failures
```

### 4. Log Analysis & Correlation
```
Log Sources:
├── Git commits (frequency, types)
├── Build logs (success/failure)
├── Runtime errors (client/server)
├── API response times
└── User session failures
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Audit System (2 hours)
1. **Playwright E2E Tests** - Complete user journey
2. **API Contract Tests** - Schema validation
3. **Error Monitoring** - Structured logging

### Phase 2: Analysis & Insights (1 hour)
1. **Log Parser** - Extract patterns from git/build logs
2. **Error Dashboard** - Real-time issue tracking
3. **Health Metrics** - Success rate monitoring

### Phase 3: Automated Pipeline (1 hour)
1. **Pre-commit Hooks** - Run audit before commits
2. **CI/CD Integration** - Automated testing
3. **Alert System** - Notify on failures

## Expected Outcomes

### Issue Detection
- **Pre-deployment** - Catch 90% of issues before they hit production
- **Real-time** - Detect production issues within 1 minute
- **Historical** - Track improvement trends over time

### Problem Classification
- **Frequency Analysis** - Which issues occur most often?
- **Impact Assessment** - Which issues block user flow?
- **Root Cause** - Common patterns in failures

### Quality Metrics
- **Success Rate** - % of complete user journeys
- **Error Distribution** - Types and frequencies
- **Recovery Time** - How quickly issues are resolved

## Audit Scope

### Critical Path Testing
1. **Landing → Explore** (button click, page load)
2. **Explore → Results** (12 dilemmas, localStorage)
3. **Results → Download** (values.md generation)
4. **Optional Research** (data export)

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty States** (no dilemmas, no responses)
2. **Network Failures** (API timeouts, 5xx errors)
3. **Data Corruption** (malformed localStorage)
4. **Race Conditions** (rapid clicks, concurrent requests)

### Performance Thresholds
- **Page Load** < 3 seconds
- **API Response** < 1 second  
- **Values Generation** < 10 seconds
- **CSV Export** < 5 seconds

## Success Criteria
- **Zero "No X found" errors** in happy path
- **95%+ success rate** for complete user journeys
- **Automated detection** of all historical issue types
- **Sub-minute** failure detection and alerting
