## Summary
The categorical analysis identified 1091 structural nonconformities in the codebase fibration.

## Missing Functions Detected
- should generate VALUES.md from response patterns
- should handle empty responses gracefully
- should correctly map motifs to ethical frameworks
- should save responses to database correctly
- should handle malformed request data gracefully
- should validate session data before processing
- should fetch random dilemmas successfully
- should fetch specific dilemma by UUID
- should handle invalid UUID gracefully
- should have consistent error format across all endpoints
- should have proper CORS headers for client integration
- should handle rate limiting gracefully
- should complete full data pipeline: responses → database → motif lookup → values generation
- should handle database connection issues gracefully
- CRITICAL: responses API saves to database correctly
- CRITICAL: values generation finds saved responses
- CRITICAL: motif data exists and is accessible
- CRITICAL: framework data exists with computational signatures
- motif extraction logic works correctly
- dilemmas have valid motif mappings
- complete data pipeline: responses → database → motif lookup → values generation
- handles invalid session gracefully
- handles malformed request data gracefully
- handles empty responses array gracefully
- should advance through dilemmas correctly
- should catch component errors gracefully
- should validate user responses
- should prevent empty VALUES.md generation
- should maintain consistent system state indicators
- Generated on

- should handle diverse preferences across different domains
- should handle incomplete dilemma responses
- should handle no responses gracefully
- should support private VALUES.md generation
- should support research contribution path

- Architecture Category Objects: 118
- Functoriality Laws: SATISFIED

## Recommendations
1. Implement missing test infrastructure functions
2. Create missing business logic identified by categorical analysis
3. Add test coverage for critical functions to complete the fibration
4. Verify mathematical consistency after fixes
