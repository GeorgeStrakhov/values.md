- **Proportional Satisfaction**: "Each gets some of what they want"
  - Patterns: "proportional", "each gets some", "partial satisfaction", "share the burden"

### **Meta-Strategies**
- **Process Focus**: "How we decide matters more than what we decide"
  - Patterns: "process matters", "how we decide", "fair procedure", "democratic process"
- **Relationship Preservation**: "Maintaining bonds while navigating conflicts"
  - Patterns: "preserve relationship", "maintain connection", "keep trust", "relationship first"
- **Learning Orientation**: "Use conflicts as growth opportunities"
  - Patterns: "learn from", "growth opportunity", "develop through", "conflict as teacher"

## 🔬 Advanced Analysis Capabilities

### **Consistency Analysis**
```typescript
interface ConsistencyPattern {
  conflictType: string;
  resolutionHistory: Array<{
    situation: string;
    strategy: string;
    outcome: string;
  }>;
  consistencyScore: number;
  exceptions: Array<{

  }
};
```

## 🚀 Practical Extensions

### **AI Guidance Generation**
Based on conflict resolution patterns, generate specific AI interaction guidelines:

```typescript
const guidanceMapping = {
  'prioritization_dominant': 'Present clear hierarchies and help user apply their priority system',
  'synthesis_creative': 'Brainstorm creative alternatives and novel solutions',
  'contextual_adaptive': 'Help analyze context and suggest appropriate frameworks',
  'compromise_oriented': 'Focus on fair trade-offs and balanced solutions'
};
```

### **Growth Recommendations**
```typescript
const developmentSuggestions = {
  'only_prioritization': 'Explore creative synthesis approaches',
  'avoid_conflicts': 'Practice engaging with ethical tensions directly',
  'inconsistent_resolution': 'Develop clearer meta-principles for consistency',
  'context_blind': 'Consider how situation should influence ethical reasoning'
};
```

### **Dilemma Customization**
Use conflict resolution patterns to generate more targeted dilemmas:

```typescript
const targetedDilemmas = {
  'weak_in_synthesis': 'Generate dilemmas that specifically require creative integration',
  'strong_in_rights': 'Present rights vs. utility conflicts to test boundaries',
  'contextual_confusion': 'Offer same ethical core in different domains'
};
```

This approach is **immediately implementable** and would create much richer, more useful VALUES.md profiles while opening up fascinating research directions!
