- Component status updates in real-time
- Automatic refresh capabilities
- Historical tracking with timestamps

### 3. **Visual System Architecture**
- Interactive component dependency mapping
- Color-coded health status throughout the system
- Clear user journey visualization
- Technology stack organization

### 4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- 67 individual tests across 8 major components
- Performance benchmarking and duration tracking
- Error detail display with troubleshooting information
- Test suite execution with progress visualization
