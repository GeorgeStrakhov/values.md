# Deployment Guide - Values.md

## 🎯 Deployment Status

**Current Stable**: v1.1.1-clean + health check fixes
**Core Functionality**: ✅ Working (API, VALUES.md generation, mobile UI)
**Health Monitoring**: 🔄 Fixed but deployment pending

## 🔍 Lessons Learned

### API Contract Management
- **Issue**: Health check expected redirects, API returned JSON
- **Fix**: Updated health check to match API contract
- **Prevention**: Document API contracts, version interfaces

### Health Check Best Practices
- **Test behavior, not implementation**: "Can get dilemma ID?" not "Does it redirect?"
- **Separate critical from nice-to-have**: Core functionality vs monitoring
- **Layer health checks**: Basic → Comprehensive → Performance

### Deployment Verification
- **Functional Tests**: Core user journeys work
- **Health Monitoring**: System observability 
- **Contract Alignment**: All components use same interfaces
