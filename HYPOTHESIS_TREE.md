# The Hypothesis Tree: Mapping Human Meaning-Making Systems

## üå≥ **Meta-Hypothesis: The Striated Universe of Human Patterns**

**Central Conjecture**: Human decision-making reveals **stratified ontological signatures** across multiple meaning-making dimensions. By applying TF-IDF-style analysis to choice patterns, temporal dynamics, linguistic markers, and reasoning structures, we can discover deep patterns in:

```
Epistemologic ‚Üí How people know and validate truth
Axiologic ‚Üí How people assign value and meaning  
Moral ‚Üí How people determine right and wrong
Anthropologic ‚Üí How people construct identity and culture
Economic ‚Üí How people model exchange and resources
Narrative ‚Üí How people structure experience and time
Aesthetic ‚Üí How people recognize beauty and form
Ontologic ‚Üí How people categorize existence itself
```
