# The Hypothesis Tree: Mapping Human Meaning-Making Systems

## 🌳 **Meta-Hypothesis: The Striated Universe of Human Patterns**

**Central Conjecture**: Human decision-making reveals **stratified ontological signatures** across multiple meaning-making dimensions. By applying TF-IDF-style analysis to choice patterns, temporal dynamics, linguistic markers, and reasoning structures, we can discover deep patterns in:

```
Epistemologic → How people know and validate truth
Axiologic → How people assign value and meaning  
Moral → How people determine right and wrong
Anthropologic → How people construct identity and culture
Economic → How people model exchange and resources
Narrative → How people structure experience and time
Aesthetic → How people recognize beauty and form
Ontologic → How people categorize existence itself
```
