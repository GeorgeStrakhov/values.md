## 🔍 Issues Identified

The failing tests have identified **real implementation issues** (which is excellent):

### Bayesian Inference Implementation Issues
1. **NaN values in posterior probability calculations** - numerical stability problem
2. **Bayes factor computations returning unexpected values** - likelihood calculation issues
3. **Credible interval edge cases** - boundary condition handling

### Resolution Strategy
These failures indicate the Bayesian implementation needs refinement, specifically:
- Numerical stability in likelihood calculations
- Edge case handling for extreme evidence
- Proper normalization in posterior computation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Fix Bayesian inference implementation** based on test failures
2. **Add property-based testing** for mathematical properties
3. **Implement metamorphic testing** for statistical relationships

### Short-term (Week 2-3)
4. **Performance testing suite** (`tests/performance/`)
5. **Data quality testing** (`tests/quality/`)
6. **Cross-platform validation** against R/Python

### Medium-term (Week 4-6)
7. **Simulation-based validation** with Monte Carlo methods
8. **Adversarial testing** for robustness
9. **Real-world data validation** studies
