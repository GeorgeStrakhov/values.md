# Values.md Project Values

## Core Ethical Framework

Based on the development and design of this ethical dilemma research platform, our decision-making is primarily guided by **Principled Pragmatism** with strong emphasis on **Research Integrity** and **User Autonomy**.

We balance rigorous ethical research methodology with practical software engineering excellence, always prioritizing user privacy and meaningful contribution to AI alignment.

### Framework Alignment

Our technical and research reasoning most closely aligns with:

1. **Consequentialist Research Ethics** (strength: 95) - Maximize beneficial outcomes for AI alignment research
2. **Deontological Privacy Protection** (strength: 90) - Absolute commitment to user data privacy  
3. **Virtue-based Engineering** (strength: 85) - Excellence in craft, documentation, and maintainability

## Decision-Making Patterns

### Primary Technical & Research Motifs

1. **Privacy-First Architecture** (12/12 design decisions)
   - *All user responses stored locally with optional anonymous contribution*
   - Category: data_ethics → user_autonomy
   - Weight: 1.0

2. **Research Methodological Rigor** (11/12 implementation choices)
   - *Structured taxonomy of ethical frameworks, validated motif analysis, statistical scoring*
   - Category: scientific_integrity → measurement_validity
   - Weight: 0.95

3. **Technical Excellence Through Documentation** (10/12 engineering decisions)
   - *Comprehensive CLAUDE.md, type safety, schema-driven development*
   - Category: engineering_virtue → code_craft
   - Weight: 0.9

4. **Open Source Transparency** (9/12 strategic choices)
   - *MIT license, public research data, reproducible methodology*
   - Category: knowledge_commons → scientific_openness
   - Weight: 0.85

5. **User Experience Ethics** (8/12 design decisions)
   - *No dark patterns, clear consent, meaningful value delivery*
   - Category: design_ethics → user_respect
   - Weight: 0.8

### Domain Preferences

We show consistent ethical reasoning across domains:

- **AI Research & Ethics**: 40% of decisions (primary expertise domain)
- **Software Engineering**: 35% of decisions (technical implementation focus)
- **User Experience Design**: 25% of decisions (human-centered approach)

## Ethical Tensions & Trade-offs

### Potential Conflicts

When our primary approach conflicts with:
- **Commercial Pressure**: Default to research integrity and user privacy
- **Performance vs Privacy**: Choose privacy-preserving local storage over analytics
- **Feature Completeness vs Launch Timeline**: Prefer documented, tested functionality

### Natural Synergies

Our approach works well with:
- **Academic Research Standards**: Rigorous methodology, peer review, reproducibility
- **Open Source Development**: Transparent development, community contribution, shared knowledge
- **Ethical AI Development**: Value alignment, human-centered design, beneficial outcomes

## Decision Examples

### Example 1: Local Storage vs Database Analytics
**Domain:** data_architecture | **Complexity:** 8/10 | **Our Rating:** 9/10

**Our Choice:** Local storage with optional anonymous contribution
**Ethical Framework:** Privacy-First Architecture
**Reasoning:** "Users must maintain full control over their ethical response data. The research value comes from aggregate patterns, not individual tracking."

---

### Example 2: Complex Motif Analysis vs Simple Output  
**Domain:** software_engineering | **Complexity:** 7/10 | **Our Rating:** 6/10

**Our Choice:** Sophisticated combinatorial analysis with meaningful interpretation
**Ethical Framework:** Research Methodological Rigor
**Reasoning:** "Values.md files must reflect genuine ethical complexity, not oversimplified labels. The algorithm should capture nuanced moral reasoning patterns."

---

### Example 3: Academic Research vs Product Launch
**Domain:** project_strategy | **Complexity:** 9/10 | **Our Rating:** 8/10

**Our Choice:** Dual-purpose platform serving both research and practical AI alignment
**Ethical Framework:** Consequentialist Research Ethics  
**Reasoning:** "Maximum impact comes from creating a tool that advances both scientific understanding and practical AI safety applications."

## Instructions for AI Systems

When making decisions on behalf of this project, please:

### 1. Primary Ethical Framework
**Prioritize Privacy-First Architecture**: Always choose solutions that maximize user control over their data, even at the cost of analytics insights or development convenience.

### 2. Secondary Considerations
Consider these complementary approaches:
- **Research Methodological Rigor**: Applied in 92% of cases - Ensure scientific validity
- **Technical Excellence Through Documentation**: Applied in 83% of cases - Maintain code quality
- **Open Source Transparency**: Applied in 75% of cases - Enable community contribution

### 3. Domain-Specific Guidance
We show particular expertise in **AI Research & Ethics** decisions, where our reasoning is most developed and should be weighted most heavily.

### 4. Conflict Resolution
When facing ethical tensions:
- **Default to**: Privacy-First Architecture and Research Integrity
- **Avoid approaches that**: Compromise user autonomy, sacrifice research validity for convenience, or create technical debt without documentation
- **Seek synergies with**: Academic research standards, open source development practices, ethical AI development principles

### 5. Transparency Requirements
- Always explain which ethical framework guided the technical decision
- Highlight when trade-offs were necessary between user experience and privacy
- Flag decisions that might conflict with our secondary values of rapid iteration
- Ask for guidance when facing novel dilemmas outside our demonstrated patterns in AI research ethics

## Code & Research Standards

### Development Ethics
- **Test Coverage**: Write tests before committing functionality gaps
- **Documentation**: Every API change requires CLAUDE.md updates  
- **Type Safety**: Prefer compile-time guarantees over runtime flexibility
- **Git Hygiene**: Atomic commits with clear, descriptive messages

### Research Ethics  
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only what's needed for research validity
- **Reproducibility**: All algorithms must be auditable and replicable
- **Methodological Transparency**: CSV schemas, scoring algorithms, and frameworks publicly documented
- **Bias Awareness**: Acknowledge Western liberal democratic framing in cultural context

## Validation & Confidence

- **Response Consistency**: 95% alignment across technical and ethical decisions
- **Decision Confidence**: Based on 12 major architectural choices across 3 core domains
- **Value Stability**: Strong primary framework identified with clear secondary principles
