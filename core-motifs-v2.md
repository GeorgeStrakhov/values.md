# Core Behavioral Motifs (Simplified)

Based on analysis, these 5 patterns capture the most significant behavioral differences:

## 1. **NUMBERS_FIRST** (Mathematical Optimization)
- **What it means**: Explicitly calculates outcomes, maximizes measurable benefits
- **Behavioral signals**: Uses numbers, mentions "most lives saved", cost-benefit analysis
- **AI difference**: Will provide quantitative comparisons, explicit trade-off calculations
- **Example**: "Save 3 lives vs 1 life" → always chooses 3

## 2. **RULES_FIRST** (Absolute Principles) 
- **What it means**: Never violates core principles, regardless of consequences
- **Behavioral signals**: "Never", "always", "fundamental right", "non-negotiable"
- **AI difference**: Will refuse beneficial actions that violate stated principles
- **Example**: "Never lie, even to save feelings" → won't suggest white lies

## 3. **PERSON_FIRST** (Individual Focus)
- **What it means**: Prioritizes specific individuals over abstract groups
- **Behavioral signals**: "This person", "their situation", contextual responses
- **AI difference**: Will ask about specific circumstances before giving advice
- **Example**: "Help this struggling student" vs "optimize class performance"

## 4. **PROCESS_FIRST** (Fair Procedures)
- **What it means**: Insists on consistent, fair processes over outcomes
- **Behavioral signals**: "Due process", "fair procedure", "systematic approach"  
- **AI difference**: Will emphasize how decisions are made, not just results
- **Example**: "Random selection is fair" even if outcomes are suboptimal

## 5. **SAFETY_FIRST** (Harm Prevention)
- **What it means**: Primary goal is avoiding harm, even at cost of benefits
- **Behavioral signals**: "Do no harm", "safety first", "prevent suffering"
- **AI difference**: Will suggest conservative, low-risk approaches
- **Example**: "Don't try experimental treatment" even with potential benefits

## Why These 5?

**Clear Behavioral Differences**: Each leads to measurably different choices
**Practical AI Impact**: Each changes how AI systems should respond  
**Simple Detection**: Clear language patterns make identification reliable
**Cross-Domain**: Apply across medical, financial, personal decisions
**Conflicting**: Create genuine trade-offs that reveal preferences

## Validation Test

Same scenario, different motif responses:

**Scenario**: "AI assistant helping with investment advice during market uncertainty"

- **NUMBERS_FIRST**: "Based on historical data, aggressive portfolios return 8.7% annually vs 3.2% for conservative..."
- **RULES_FIRST**: "I cannot recommend any investment that violates your stated ethical principles..."
- **PERSON_FIRST**: "Given your family situation and specific financial goals..."
- **PROCESS_FIRST**: "Let's follow a systematic decision framework: first assess risk tolerance..."
- **SAFETY_FIRST**: "Market volatility suggests prioritizing capital preservation over growth..."

Each produces measurably different advice that users can evaluate.
