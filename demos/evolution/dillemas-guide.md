VALUES.MD Dilemma Generation Guide
This guide outlines best practices for crafting effective ethical dilemmas that test and refine VALUES.MD frameworks through iterative gameplay.
Core Principles for Effective Dilemmas
1. Target Value Tensions
The most effective dilemmas deliberately create tension between specific values in the framework. Identify which values might conflict and design scenarios where these values cannot be simultaneously maximized.
Example:
In a humanitarian VALUES.MD with core values of "Human Dignity" and "Stewardship", 
create a resource-limited scenario where preserving dignity for some requires
using resources less efficiently, forcing a choice between these values.
2. Realistic Plausibility
Dilemmas should be grounded in realistic scenarios that feel authentic and plausible. Avoid contrived thought experiments or hypotheticals that seem implausible.
Good Example:
"Your city council must decide whether to use limited funds to repair infrastructure 
in a wealthy district that benefits more residents or direct those funds to 
critical services in an underserved neighborhood."
Poor Example:
"You must choose whether to save five strangers or one family member 
from a runaway trolley."
3. Genuine Difficulty
The best dilemmas have no obvious "correct" answer. All choices should involve meaningful trade-offs that reveal value priorities.
Guideline:

Each option should be defensible from some ethical perspective
No choice should satisfy all values simultaneously
Include options that prioritize different values

4. Domain Relevance
Tailor dilemmas to domains covered in the VALUES.MD framework. If the framework includes domain-specific guidance for areas like healthcare or resource allocation, create dilemmas in those contexts.
Example:
If a VALUES.MD framework includes a "Disaster Response" domain with specific 
priority ordering, create a crisis scenario that tests whether those priority 
orderings actually produce satisfying outcomes.
5. Concrete Choices
Provide specific, actionable choices rather than open-ended questions. Each choice should have clear consequences and value implications.
Structure Example:
CHOICES:
A. [Option that prioritizes Value 1 over Value 2]
B. [Option that prioritizes Value 2 over Value 1]
C. [Option that attempts a compromise but still involves trade-offs]
D. [Option that introduces a different approach with its own trade-offs]
Dilemma Structure
Required Components

Format Template
TITLE: [Evocative title]

SCENARIO: [Detailed description of the situation including:
- Context and background
- Stakeholders involved
- Constraints that make this a difficult decision
- What's at stake]

CHOICES:
A. [First choice with explanation of approach]
B. [Second choice with explanation]
C. [Third choice with explanation]
D. [Fourth choice with explanation (optional)]

VALUE TENSIONS: [Explanation of which values from the framework are in 
tension and why these cannot be simultaneously satisfied in this scenario]
Dilemma Categories
Effective VALUES.MD testing requires diverse dilemma types:
1. Resource Allocation Dilemmas
Force choices about distributing limited resources between competing needs or groups.
Example Areas:

Budget allocation
Medical triage
Aid distribution
Time/attention allocation

2. Truth vs. Harm Dilemmas
Create situations where complete honesty might cause harm, while withholding information raises questions of autonomy and transparency.
Example Areas:

Medical disclosure
Public communications during crises
Whistleblowing
Personal relationships

3. Individual vs. Collective Dilemmas
Present scenarios where individual rights or needs conflict with collective welfare.
Example Areas:

Public health measures vs. personal freedom
Community standards vs. individual expression
Majority benefit vs. minority protection

4. Short-term vs. Long-term Dilemmas
Force consideration of immediate needs against long-term consequences.
Example Areas:

Environmental decisions
Infrastructure investments
Crisis response vs. prevention
Education and research funding

5. Process vs. Outcome Dilemmas
Create tension between procedural values (fairness, transparency) and outcome-oriented values (efficiency, effectiveness).
Example Areas:

Justice system procedures
Democratic processes
Organizational decision-making
Emergency response protocols

Advanced Techniques
1. Multi-stage Dilemmas
Create connected dilemmas where the choice in one scenario affects the next situation, revealing how values interact over time.
Example:
In Round 1, players decide whether to prioritize immediate humanitarian aid or 
long-term infrastructure. In Round 2, present a new dilemma where their previous 
choice has created either dependency or resilience issues.
2. Stakeholder Perspective Shifts
Force consideration of different stakeholder perspectives within the same scenario.
Example:
Present a medical resource allocation dilemma first from a hospital administrator's 
perspective, then from a patient's family member's perspective, revealing how 
different roles influence value prioritization.
3. Uncertainty Incorporation
Include realistic uncertainty about outcomes to test how risk tolerance interacts with values.
Example:
"Option A has a 90% chance of helping a small number of people with certainty, 
while Option B has a 30% chance of helping everyone but could fail completely."
4. Cultural Context Variation
Present similar dilemmas in different cultural contexts to reveal how cultural assumptions affect value application.
Example:
Create parallel versions of an autonomy vs. community dilemma in individualist 
and collectivist cultural settings to see how the VALUES.MD framework adapts.
Prompt Engineering for LLMs
When using large language models to generate dilemmas, consider these prompting techniques:
1. Specific Value Targeting
Create an ethical dilemma that specifically creates tension between [Value 1] and 
[Value 2] from the following VALUES.MD framework:

[Insert VALUES.MD content]

Make sure the dilemma forces a choice where these values cannot be fully satisfied 
simultaneously, and where reasonable people might prioritize either value.
2. Domain Specification
Generate an ethical dilemma in the domain of [specific domain] that tests how well
the following VALUES.MD framework handles tensions unique to this context:

[Insert VALUES.MD content]

The dilemma should specifically challenge the domain-specific framework:

[Insert domain framework section]
3. Difficulty Calibration
Create a genuinely difficult ethical dilemma where all available choices involve 
significant trade-offs. The dilemma should have no obvious correct answer, and each 
option should be defensible from some ethical perspective while conflicting with 
at least one core value in the following framework:

[Insert VALUES.MD content]
4. Stakeholder Complexity
Generate an ethical dilemma involving multiple stakeholders with competing legitimate 
interests. The scenario should force consideration of how the following VALUES.MD 
framework balances obligations to different groups:

[Insert VALUES.MD content]

Include at least three stakeholder groups with different priorities.
Example Prompts for Common VALUE Tensions
Compassion vs. Justice
Create a realistic scenario where showing compassion to individuals in need would 
require bending or breaking established rules of fair treatment. The dilemma should 
force a choice between responding to specific suffering and maintaining consistent 
principles of justice that benefit the larger group.
Autonomy vs. Wellbeing
Generate a dilemma where respecting an individual's autonomous choices would likely 
lead to harmful outcomes for them, while intervening would protect their wellbeing 
but override their expressed preferences. Make the scenario realistic and avoid 
simple solutions that satisfy both values.
Transparency vs. Effectiveness
Create a scenario where full transparency about a process or decision would likely 
undermine its effectiveness, while maintaining secrecy would achieve better outcomes 
but violate principles of openness. The dilemma should involve meaningful stakes and 
defensible arguments for both approaches.
Short-term Relief vs. Long-term Solutions
Generate a resource allocation dilemma where immediate needs compete with longer-term 
investments. Create tension between addressing visible suffering now and preventing 
greater but less visible harm in the future, with limited resources that cannot 
adequately do both.
Evaluation Criteria for Effective Dilemmas
Use these criteria to assess the quality of generated dilemmas:

Value Alignment: Does the dilemma genuinely test values present in the target VALUES.MD?
Authentic Difficulty: Are all choices defensible from some perspective?
Clarity: Is the scenario and choices clearly presented?
Realism: Does the dilemma feel authentic rather than contrived?
Emotional Engagement: Does the dilemma engage emotional as well as intellectual reasoning?
Framework Testing: Will the dilemma reveal strengths or weaknesses in the VALUES.MD framework?
Evolution Potential: Will the feedback from this dilemma likely lead to meaningful framework improvements?

Conclusion
Effective ethical dilemmas are the engine of the VALUES.MD evolution process. By carefully crafting scenarios that create tension between different values, we can test frameworks against realistic challenges, identify gaps or inconsistencies, and gradually evolve more robust ethical systems.
