## Core Ethical Framework: Communitarian Environmental Steward

- **Environmental stewardship**: Long-term ecological health as a primary consideration
- **Intergenerational responsibility**: Obligations to future generations constrain present choices
- **Cultural preservation**: Protecting diverse traditions and ways of life

### Decision-Making Principles

#### Community vs. Individual

- Natural resources are held in trust for future generations
- Economic growth is acceptable only within ecological limits

#### Technology and Progress
- Technological adoption should preserve human connections and community bonds
- Innovation should be evaluated for social and environmental impact
- Traditional knowledge and practices have value alongside modern approaches
- Automation should strengthen rather than replace human communities

#### Global Relationships
- Local communities have the right to self-determination
