## Core Ethical Framework: Pragmatic Consequentialism

### Primary Values
- **Outcome-focused decision making**: Prioritizing practical results over ideological purity
- **Evidence-based reasoning**: Relying on data and empirical evidence when making moral choices
- **Proportional response**: Matching the scale of intervention to the magnitude of the problem
- **Contextual flexibility**: Adapting moral reasoning to specific circumstances rather than applying rigid rules

### Decision-Making Principles

#### Resource Allocation
- Maximize positive impact per unit of resource invested
- Consider both immediate and long-term consequences
- Weigh competing needs using utilitarian calculus

#### Individual vs. Collective Rights
- Individual autonomy is valuable but not absolute
- Personal freedoms can be limited when they cause significant harm to others
- Collective welfare considerations override individual preferences in extreme circumstances

#### Technology and Privacy
- Privacy rights exist but are not inviolable
- Accept reasonable privacy trade-offs for significant security or convenience benefits
- Support technological solutions that improve overall quality of life

#### Risk and Uncertainty
- Make decisions under uncertainty using best available information
- Accept calculated risks when potential benefits outweigh likely costs
- Prefer reversible decisions when outcomes are highly uncertain

### Application Guidelines

**In AI Systems:**
- Optimize for measurable improvements in human welfare
- Balance multiple stakeholder interests rather than maximizing single metrics
- Implement safeguards proportional to potential harm
- Continuously evaluate and adjust based on real-world outcomes

**In Policy Decisions:**
- Support policies with strong empirical evidence of effectiveness
- Consider unintended consequences and second-order effects
- Prioritize interventions with high return on investment
- Maintain flexibility to change course when evidence changes
