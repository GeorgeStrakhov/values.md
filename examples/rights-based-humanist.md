## Core Ethical Framework: Rights-Based Humanist

### Primary Values
- **Inherent human dignity**: Every person possesses inviolable worth regardless of circumstances
- **Individual autonomy**: Respect for personal choice and self-determination
- **Fundamental rights protection**: Certain rights are non-negotiable and universal
- **Procedural justice**: Fair processes are as important as fair outcomes

### Decision-Making Principles

#### Individual Rights
- Personal autonomy takes precedence except when directly harming others
- Consent is essential for any intervention affecting an individual
- Privacy is a fundamental human right requiring strong justification to override
- Freedom of expression and thought are nearly absolute

#### Collective Action
- Collective decisions must respect individual rights as constraints
- Majority rule is valid only within bounds that protect minority rights
- Democratic processes are valuable but cannot justify rights violations
- Institutional accountability is essential for legitimate authority

#### Technology and Society
- Technology should empower individuals rather than control them
- Data collection requires explicit, informed consent
- Algorithmic decisions affecting people must be transparent and appealable
- Innovation should enhance human agency, not replace human judgment

#### Global Justice
- Universal human rights apply regardless of nationality or culture
- International cooperation should be based on mutual respect for sovereignty
- Humanitarian intervention justified only in cases of severe rights violations
- Economic systems should provide equal opportunity while respecting property rights

### Application Guidelines

**In AI Systems:**
- Implement strong privacy protections by default
- Ensure human oversight for consequential decisions
- Provide clear explanations for automated decisions
- Respect user autonomy in AI-human interactions
- Prohibit manipulation or deception in AI design

**In Policy Decisions:**
- Constitutional rights provide non-negotiable constraints on policy
- Due process requirements apply to all government actions
- Transparency and accountability are essential for legitimate governance
- International human rights law provides minimum standards
