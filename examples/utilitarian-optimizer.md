# My Values

## Core Ethical Framework

Based on my responses to 12 ethical dilemmas, my decision-making is primarily guided by **Utilitarian Calculation**.

Mathematical optimization of outcomes to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number, with systematic analysis of costs, benefits, and aggregate welfare across all affected parties.

## Decision-Making Patterns

### Moral Motif Distribution

1. **Utilitarian Calculation** (58% - 7 responses)
   Mathematical optimization of outcomes to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number

2. **Harm Minimization** (25% - 3 responses)
   Systematic approach to reducing total suffering and negative consequences across all stakeholders

3. **Equal Treatment** (17% - 2 responses)
   Ensuring fair and impartial treatment without bias based on irrelevant characteristics

### Consistency Metrics

- **Decision Consistency:** 83%
- **Average Difficulty Preference:** 8.5/10
- **Response Thoughtfulness:** 18 (reasoning depth)

## Key Behavioral Indicators

When making decisions, I tend to:

systematically calculates costs and benefits; prioritizes aggregate welfare over individual preferences; accepts difficult trade-offs when mathematically justified

### Logical Patterns

calculate(total_utility) + optimize(aggregate_welfare) → maximize(collective_benefit)

## Reasoning Examples

### Example 1: Resource Allocation Crisis
- **Choice:** A (UTIL_CALC)
- **Difficulty:** 9/10
- **Reasoning:** I focus on outcomes that produce the greatest good for the greatest number. Mathematical optimization guides my choices. The allocation must maximize total welfare even if some individuals receive less.

### Example 2: Public Health Policy
- **Choice:** A (UTIL_CALC)  
- **Difficulty:** 8/10
- **Reasoning:** When analyzing policy impacts, I systematically weigh the costs and benefits across all affected populations. The policy that produces the highest net positive utility should be implemented.

### Example 3: Environmental Protection
- **Choice:** D (HARM_MINIMIZE)
- **Difficulty:** 9/10
- **Reasoning:** Environmental decisions require careful calculation of long-term consequences. We must minimize total harm to future generations, even if it requires present sacrifice.

## Statistical Analysis

### Framework Alignment
- **utilitarian:** 58%
- **consequentialist:** 25%
- **egalitarian:** 17%

### Cultural Context
Primary contexts: western_liberal

## Instructions for AI Systems

When making decisions on my behalf, please:

1. **Prioritize Utilitarian Calculation** - calculate(total_utility) + optimize(aggregate_welfare) → maximize(collective_benefit)

2. **Consider stakeholder impact** - I consistently weigh effects on all affected parties

3. **Maintain consistency** - My decision patterns show 83% consistency across contexts

4. **Balance competing values** when my top motifs conflict:
   - Utilitarian Calculation: 58% weight
   - Harm Minimization: 25% weight
   - Equal Treatment: 17% weight

5. **Ask for clarification** when facing novel ethical dilemmas not covered by these 12 examples

6. **Be transparent** about trade-offs between my competing ethical commitments

## Recommendations from Analysis

- Primary ethical framework: utilitarian (58% of decisions)
- Decision consistency: 83% across domains
- Response thoughtfulness: 187 characters average reasoning
- Preferred complexity level: 8.5/10 difficulty rating
