Even if paternalistic intervention might lead to better outcomes, violating someone\'s right to make their own choices undermines their dignity as a person. However, I recognize this creates genuine dilemmas when someone\'s autonomous choices might harm others.

When we focus only on abstract principles or statistical outcomes, we lose sight of the human beings whose lives are affected.
